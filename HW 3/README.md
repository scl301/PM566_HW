## APIs

### Number of Papers

``` r
# Downloading the website
website <- xml2::read_html("https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=sars-cov-2+trial+vaccine")

# Finding the counts
counts <- xml2::xml_find_first(website, "/html/body/main/div[9]/div[2]/div[2]/div[1]")

# Turning it into text
counts <- as.character(counts)

# Extracting the data using regex
stringr::str_extract(counts, "[0-9,]+")
```

    ## [1] "4,644"

### IDs

``` r
library(httr)
query_ids <- GET(
  url   = "https://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/esearch.fcgi",
  query = list(db= "pubmed", term= "sars-cov-2 trial vaccine", retmax= 250)
)

ids <- httr::content(query_ids)
```

``` r
# Turn the result into a character vector
ids <- as.character(ids)

# Find all the ids 
ids <- stringr::str_extract_all(ids, "<Id>[[:digit:]]+</Id>")[[1]]

# Remove all the leading and trailing <Id> </Id>. Make use of "|"
ids <- stringr::str_remove_all(ids, "</?Id>")

publications <- GET(
  url   = "https://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/efetch.fcgi",
  query = list(
    db = "pubmed",
    id = paste(ids, collapse = ","),
    retmax = 250,
    rettype = "abstract"
    )
)

# Turning the output into character vector

As of this writing, 761,071,826 million cases have been diagnosed worldwide, with 6,879,677 million deaths accorded by WHO organization and has spread to 228 countries. The number of deaths is closely connected to the growth of innate immune cells in the lungs, mainly macrophages, which generate inflammatory cytokines (especially IL-6 and IL-1β) that induce “cytokine storm syndrome” (CSS), multi-organ failure, and death. We focus on promising natural products and their biologically active chemical constituents as potential phytopharmaceuticals that target virus-induced pro-inflammatory cytokines. Successful therapy for this condition is currently rare, and the introduction of an effective vaccine might take months. Blocking viral entrance and replication and regulating humoral and cellular immunity in the uninfected population are the most often employed treatment approaches for viral infections. Unfortunately, no presently FDA-approved medicine can prevent or reduce SARS-CoV-2 access and reproduction. Until now, the most important element in disease severity has been the host’s immune response activation or suppression. Several medicines have been adapted for COVID-19 patients, including arbidol, favipiravir, ribavirin, lopinavir, ritonavir, hydroxychloroquine, chloroquine, dexamethasone, and anti-inflammatory pharmaceutical drugs, such as tocilizumab, glucocorticoids, anakinra (IL-1β cytokine inhibition), and siltuximab (IL-6 cytokine inhibition). However, these synthetic medications and therapies have several side effects, including heart failure, permanent retinal damage in the case of hydroxyl-chloroquine, and liver destruction in the case of remdesivir. This review summarizes four strategies for fighting cytokine storms and immunomodulatory deficiency induced by COVID-19 using natural product therapy as a potential therapeutic measure to control cytokine storms.

High levels of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccine hesitancy contributed to significantly reduced vaccination coverage in the eligible population especially among healthcare workers, comorbid and older people. The existing global evidence suggests misinformation through social media to accentuate, while newspaper and mainstream media reporting to be protective against vaccine hesitancy during the COVID-19 pandemic. Content analysis of regular press coverage of COVID-19 vaccination in India during the period of initial deployment and until the onset of the second wave of the pandemic can provide useful learnings and strengthen preparedness for addressing potential vaccine hesitancy concerns during future pandemics. Therefore, we conducted this inductive content analysis of press coverage related to the COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy in India prior to the second (Delta) wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods We examined news reports related to COVID-19 vaccination in India for the period from 1st January 2021 to 28 February 2021 from a high circulation English language daily (Hindustan Times), Hindi (vernacular) language daily (Dainik Jagran), and English language news reports from selected digital news portals. The inclusion criterion was any news report related to COVID-19 vaccination including editorials and guest opinion pieces that could potentially generate COVID-19-related vaccine hesitancy. The news items were classified depending on their potential to drive vaccine hesitancy by either avoiding reporting of positive information related to COVID-19 vaccines, or attributing directly or indirectly, negative or misleading commentary relating to vaccine safety or efficacy. Reports with possible risk of increasing vaccine hesitancy were further analyzed based on content, source of information, and the extent of fact-checking. Results Most of the published newspaper reports examined in this study echoed official news sources and views from government health agencies promoting COVID-19 vaccine acceptance and dispelling doubts on concerns regarding vaccine safety. There were eight unique newspaper reports after excluding duplicated bilingual entries and four news items from online digital Indian news sources that met our criterion of reports with possible contribution to vaccine hesitancy. The reports possibly contributed to vaccine hesitancy were grouped into two themes: (i) Doubts on the safety and efficacy of local manufactured vaccines: most of these reports focused on the granting of emergency use authorization for Covaxin (BBV152) in ‘clinical trial mode’ without the completion and publication of Phase-3 efficacy data (ii). Doubts on vaccine requirement considering high seroprevalence and reduced virus transmission. Conclusions Concerns about the efficacy and safety of Covaxin (BBV152), safety of the Covishield vaccine, and questioning the necessity of immunizing all adults with COVID-19 vaccines were observed in multiple press reports with attempts at politicization of vaccination-related decisions.

Existing medicines and vaccines could not cure and control this deadly disease. In this regard, several vaccines have been proposed and designed to control this infection’s spread effectively. Along with these vaccines, the general population should adopt specific lifestyle interventions to strengthen their immune system and combat deadly viruses. We used Google Scholar and PubMed databases to find the related information using key terms such as ‘COVID-19’, ‘COVID-19 AND Vaccine efficacy’, ‘Lifestyle intervention AND COVID-19’, and “Lifestyle intervention AND Vaccines,” etc. Only articles that discussed the interactions between lifestyle intervention and the efficacy of COVID-19 vaccines were selected for this study. Several previous clinical trials and scientific observations with influenza, polio, and other viral vaccines have demonstrated that vaccine response varies across individuals for antibody titer, independent of vaccine antigenicity. This different vaccine response observed among individuals is attributed to several factors such as dietary and nutritional habits, physical activity, stress and sleep deprivation, deficiency of micronutrients (minerals, vitamins), gut microbiota composition, immunosenescence, smoking, and drinking habits. Although there is not much information about COVID-19 vaccine efficacy and lifestyle interventions, experience with other vaccines can undoubtedly be used to suggest lifestyle interventions to improve COVID-19 vaccine efficacy. These lifestyle interventions may boost antibody responses against COVID-19 vaccines, leading to higher protection from the disease, especially among elderly and immunocompromised people. In conclusion, the present review attempts to understand the role of various nutritional and psychological factors that lead to poor vaccine response and suggests specific nutritional and psychological interventions that can enhance vaccine efficacy and improve immune response against COVID-19 vaccines.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

Because HCQ has a proposed multimodal mechanism of action and a well-established safety profile, it is often investigated as a repurposed therapeutic for a range of indications. There is a large degree of uncertainty in HCQ pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters which complicates dose selection when investigating its use in new disease states. Complications with HCQ dose selection emerged as multiple clinical trials investigated HCQ as a potential therapeutic in the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition to uncertainty in baseline HCQ PK parameters, it was not clear if disease-related consequences of SARS-CoV-2 infection/COVID-19 would be expected to impact the PK of HCQ and its primary metabolite desethylhydroxychloroquine (DHCQ). To address the question whether SARS-CoV-2 infection/COVID-19 impacted HCQ and DHCQ PK, dried blood spot samples were collected from SARS-CoV-2(-)/(+) participants administered HCQ. When a previously published physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) model was used to fit the data, the variability in exposure of HCQ and DHCQ was not adequately captured and DHCQ concentrations were overestimated. Improvements to the previous PBPK model were made by incorporating the known range of blood to plasma concentration ratios (B/P) for each compound, adjusting HCQ and DHCQ distribution settings, and optimizing DHCQ clearance. The final PBPK model adequately captured the HCQ and DHCQ concentrations observed in SARS-CoV-2(-)/(+)participants, and incorporating COVID-19-associated changes in cytochrome P450 activity did not further improve model performance for the SARS-CoV-2(+) population. © 2023 The Authors.

Because HCQ has a proposed multimodal mechanism of action and a well-established safety profile, it is often investigated as a repurposed therapeutic for a range of indications. There is a large degree of uncertainty in HCQ pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters which complicates dose selection when investigating its use in new disease states. Complications with HCQ dose selection emerged as multiple clinical trials investigated HCQ as a potential therapeutic in the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition to uncertainty in baseline HCQ PK parameters, it was not clear if disease-related consequences of SARS-CoV-2 infection/COVID-19 would be expected to impact the PK of HCQ and its primary metabolite desethylhydroxychloroquine (DHCQ). To address the question whether SARS-CoV-2 infection/COVID-19 impacted HCQ and DHCQ PK, dried blood spot samples were collected from SARS-CoV-2(-)/(+) participants administered HCQ. When a previously published physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) model was used to fit the data, the variability in exposure of HCQ and DHCQ was not adequately captured and DHCQ concentrations were overestimated. Improvements to the previous PBPK model were made by incorporating the known range of blood to plasma concentration ratios (B/P) for each compound, adjusting HCQ and DHCQ distribution settings, and optimizing DHCQ clearance. The final PBPK model adequately captured the HCQ and DHCQ concentrations observed in SARS-CoV-2(-)/(+)participants, and incorporating COVID-19-associated changes in cytochrome P450 activity did not further improve model performance for the SARS-CoV-2(+) population. © 2023 The Authors.

Hence, developing therapeutics against SARS-CoV-2 remains a core priority in the fight against COVID-19. Most of the drugs that have received emergency use authorization for treating SARS-CoV-2 infection exhibit a number of limitations, including side effects and questionable efficacy. This challenge is further compounded by reinfection after vaccination and the high likelihood of mutations, as well as the emergence of viral escape mutants that render SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein-targeting vaccines ineffective. Employing de novo drug synthesis or repurposing to discover broad-spectrum antivirals that target highly conserved pathways within the viral machinery is a focus of current research. In a recent drug repurposing study, masitinib, a clinically safe drug against the human coronavirus OC43 (HCoV-OC43), was identified as an antiviral agent with effective inhibitory activity against the SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro. Masitinib is currently under clinical trial in combination with isoquercetin in hospitalized patients (NCT04622865). Nevertheless, masitinib has kinase-related side effects; hence, the development of masitinib analogs with lower anti-tyrosine kinase activity becomes necessary. In this study, in an attempt to address this limitation, we executed a comprehensive virtual workflow in silico to discover drug-like compounds matching selected pharmacophore features in the SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro-bound state of masitinib. We identified a novel lead compound, “masitinibL”, a drug-like analog of masitinib that demonstrated strong inhibitory properties against the SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro. In addition, masitinibL further displayed low selectivity for tyrosine kinases, which strongly suggests that masitinibL is a highly promising therapeutic that is preferable to masitinib. © 2023.

Despite these successes on the individual level, vaccination of the population is essential to relieving hospitals and intensive care units. In this context, understanding the effects of vaccination and its lag-time on the population-level dynamics becomes necessary to adapt the vaccination campaigns and prepare for future pandemics. This work applied a quasi-Poisson regression with a distributed lag linear model on German data from a scientific data platform to quantify the effects of vaccination and its lag times on the number of hospital and intensive care patients, adjusting for the influences of non-pharmaceutical interventions and their time trends. We separately evaluated the effects of the first, second and third doses administered in Germany. The results revealed a decrease in the number of hospital and intensive care patients for high vaccine coverage. The vaccination provides a significant protective effect when at least approximately 40% of people are vaccinated, whatever the dose considered. We also found a time-delayed effect of the vaccination. Indeed, the effect on the number of hospital patients is immediate for the first and second doses while for the third dose about 15 days are necessary to have a strong protective effect. Concerning the effect on the number of intensive care patients, a significant protective response was obtained after a lag time of about 15-20 days for the three doses. However, complex time trends, e.g. due to new variants, which are independent of vaccination make the detection of these findings challenging. Our results provide additional information about the protective effects of vaccines against SARS-CoV-2; they are in line with previous findings and complement the individual-level evidence of clinical trials. Findings from this work could help public health authorities efficiently direct their actions against SARS-CoV-2 and be well-prepared for future pandemics.

The Matrix-M adjuvant consists of two distinct fractions of saponins purified from the Quillaja saponaria Molina tree, combined with cholesterol and phospholipids to form 40-nm open cage-like nanoparticles, achieving potent adjuvanticity with a favorable safety profile. Matrix-M induces early activation of innate immune cells at the injection site and in the draining lymph nodes. This translates into improved magnitude and quality of the antibody response to the antigen, broadened epitope recognition, and the induction of a Th1-dominant immune response. Matrix-M-adjuvanted vaccines have a favorable safety profile and are well tolerated in clinical trials. In this review, we discuss the latest findings on the mechanisms of action, efficacy, and safety of Matrix-M adjuvant and other saponin-based adjuvants, with a focus on the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) subunit vaccine candidate NVX-CoV2373 developed to prevent coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
